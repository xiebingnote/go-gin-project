# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
cluster.name: es-cluster
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
node.name: es01
#
# Add custom attributes to the node:
#
#node.attr.rack: r1
#
# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
#
# Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):
#
path.data: /usr/share/elasticsearch/data
#
# Path to log files:
#
path.logs: /usr/share/elasticsearch/logs
#
# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
#
# Lock the memory on startup:
#
#bootstrap.memory_lock: true
#
# Make sure that the heap size is set to about half the memory available
# on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this
# limit.
#
# Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# By default Elasticsearch is only accessible on localhost. Set a different
# address here to expose this node on the network:
#
network.host: 0.0.0.0
#
# By default Elasticsearch listens for HTTP traffic on the first free port it
# finds starting at 9200. Set a specific HTTP port here:
#
http.port: 9200
#
# For more information, consult the network module documentation.
#
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
# Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when this node is started:
# The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
#
#discovery.seed_hosts: ["host1", "host2"]
#
# Bootstrap the cluster using an initial set of master-eligible nodes:
#
#cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["node-1", "node-2"]
#
# For more information, consult the discovery and cluster formation module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Various -----------------------------------
#
# Allow wildcard deletion of indices:
#
#action.destructive_requires_name: false

# ---------------------------------- Security ----------------------------------
#
# Enable security features
xpack.security.enabled: false
xpack.security.enrollment.enabled: false

# Enable encryption for HTTP API client connections, such as Kibana, Logstash, and Agents
xpack.security.http.ssl:
  enabled: false

# Enable encryption and mutual authentication between cluster nodes
xpack.security.transport.ssl:
  enabled: false

# ---------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
# Single node discovery for development
discovery.type: single-node

# ---------------------------------- Performance ----------------------------------
# Disable machine learning for development
xpack.ml.enabled: false

# Disable monitoring
xpack.monitoring.enabled: false

# Disable watcher
xpack.watcher.enabled: false

# ---------------------------------- Logging -----------------------------------
# Set the logging level
logger.level: INFO

# ---------------------------------- Development Settings ----------------------
# These settings are for development only and should not be used in production

# Allow HTTP requests from any origin (CORS)
http.cors.enabled: true
http.cors.allow-origin: "*"
http.cors.allow-headers: "X-Requested-With,Content-Type,Content-Length,Authorization"

# Disable bootstrap checks for development
bootstrap.system_call_filter: false
